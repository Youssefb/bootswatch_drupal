Bootswatch for Drupal
=================

This package includes ports of all the Bootswatch (http://bootswatch.com/) themes to drupal as bootstrap sub-themes.
This also includes a fully packaged version of drupal's bootstrap instance (beta3) to avoid licensing conflicts on
d.o. between Apache 2.0 and GPL 2.0.

How to use this:
Download the package, place it in your sites/all/themes/custom folder.  Place all these files there or, if you want a
fresh copy of bootstrap grab a new copy from http://drupal.org/project/bootstrap and http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/
and put the parts back together.
